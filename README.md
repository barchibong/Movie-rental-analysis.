A movie rental company that previously operated physical stores globally encountered formidable competition from streaming platforms. To maintain competitiveness, the management devised a plan to leverage existing movie licenses by launching an online rental service. 

I was brought in as a data analyst within the business intelligence department to support the rollout strategy for this new online video service.

My initial responsibility involved migrating all company data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). 

Subsequently, I utilized SQL to delve into the data, addressing intricate business queries. I employed a range of tools and skills, including SQL expertise, proficiency in relational databases, and various techniques such as querying, filtering, cleaning, summarizing data, joining tables, incorporating subqueries, and utilizing common table expressions.
